### The problem
_Isohexadecane._ _Alkyl Benzene Sulfonate._ _Sodium Catearyl Sulfate._ Reading an ingredients list is no fun. It's even worse when its given in size 5 font on the side of a bottle. No wonder why so many of us opt-out of reading what the products we use are made off. These lists are important to many, since certain ingredients do not cope with certain body types. Examples of this are as such:
- Over 50 million American's experience allergies every year, with children being impacted more than any other demographic.
- Many people with curly/thick hair have excess dryness with hair products containing certain ingredients.
- Some ingredients are more harmful to the environment then others, and growingly consumers are attempting to make sustainable choices.

_Consumer's are unaware of what each ingredient in an ingredient list means and it is tedious to search up each ingredient._

### Our Solution
In investigating the key pain points for consumers we spoke to some of our friends and found that hair products is an area where they care about the ingredients. In interviewing them, we got a sense of the key painpoints for them and prioritized as such:
1. Sifting through the small ingredients list to look for a specific item
2. Understanding how bad the ingredients are for their specific hair type
3. Comparing different products

Deetect efficiently scans a ingredient list and compares it against our internal database to inform you about the ingredients in your product and their impact on your hair. We built this MVP specifically for ingredients involved in hair products. Our seamless design creates a simple, yet informative user experience.

### Techstack
We used this nwHacks to learn new technologies and this was the first time we used _Flutter, Firebase and Google ML Kit_.
